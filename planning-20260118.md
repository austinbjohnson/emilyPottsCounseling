# Emily Potts Counseling - Migration Prep

Source: `agentPrep-2026018` (prior agent notes).

## Decisions (current)

- Build style: plain HTML + CSS
- Contact form: `mailto:` for now (email aliases in place) -> use `hello@emilypotts.ca`
- Keep `/home` as an alias that redirects to `/`
- GitHub Pages: preview on `*.github.io` before DNS cutover
- Domain email: iCloud in use -> preserve MX/TXT on DNS changes
- Analytics: GA4 (free)
- Speaking page: keep a placeholder "Coming soon" page until Emily confirms content

## Issues

- [x] Header/menu floats awkwardly because `.site-header` uses `position: sticky` with `top: 6%` instead of being pinned to the top.

- [ ] UI polish checklist (GitHub issue #49): https://github.com/austinbjohnson/emilyPottsCounseling/issues/49

## Current site map and content

Core pages and content to rebuild:
- Home (`/`) with hero + intro + 3 service tiles (Therapy / Speaking / Workshops) + CTA sections
- About (`/about`) with bio, qualifications, and multiple images
- Services & Fees (`/services-and-fees`) with service descriptions and pricing (e.g., 50-minute session price listed on-page)
- Therapy (`/therapy`) with "Climate Aware Therapy" section and bullet points
- FAQs (`/faqs`) with accordion-style Q&A content
- Resources index (`/resources`) listing two posts
- Resource post 1 (`/resources/Blog%20Post%20Title%20One-y2epy-y63ns`) (note the odd slug with spaces encoded)
- Resource post 2 (`/resources/exploring-solutions-for-climate-anxiety`)
- Contact (`/contact`) with copy + a "Book a free 15-minute call" button linking to JaneApp, and a "fill out the form below" section (likely a Squarespace form you will need to replace)
- Privacy policy (`/privacy-page`) long-form privacy notice

Alias/redirect:
- `/home` should redirect to `/` to avoid breaking old links

External integrations:
- Newsletter -> Substack (areyouok.substack.com)
- Book Now -> JaneApp (peakresilience.janeapp.com)
- Analytics -> GA4 (free)

Media and assets:
- Images are hosted on Squarespace's CDN right now (download and re-host them in the GitHub repo, otherwise they may disappear or break when the Squarespace site is cancelled).

Red flag to verify in a real browser:
- The footer includes a "Speaking" link, but `/speaking` returns 404. Confirm whether it should exist or the link should be removed.

## Approach: rebuild from reference, not clone Squarespace output

Treat the current site as the spec (layout, typography, spacing, components) and recreate the layout with:
- Header / nav component
- Footer component
- Reusable section patterns (hero, 2-column image/text, tile grid, CTA band, quote block, blog list, blog post template)
- Content migrated into those templates
- Replace Squarespace-only features (forms) with static-friendly alternatives

## Action plan

### 0) Pre-flight checks (15-20 min)

Goal: avoid breaking domain/email/privacy.
- Confirm you have:
  - Emily's explicit OK to copy her content and publish on GitHub Pages
  - Access to domain DNS (wherever emilypotts.ca is managed)
  - Whether she uses domain email (MX records). Preserve MX/TXT if she does.
- Decide preview-first vs cutover today
  - Recommended: publish a preview on *.github.io first, get sign-off, then cutover DNS later.

### 1) Inventory the site (20-30 min)

Goal: do not miss a page or break URLs.

Checklist of URLs to reproduce exactly:
- `/`
- `/about`
- `/services-and-fees`
- `/therapy`
- `/faqs`
- `/resources`
- `/resources/Blog%20Post%20Title%20One-y2epy-y63ns`
- `/resources/exploring-solutions-for-climate-anxiety`
- `/contact`
- `/privacy-page`

Also add:
- Any hidden pages found in Squarespace admin (unlinked pages)
- The "Speaking" link destination (verify actual URL in browser)

### 2) Scrape/backup content safely (30-45 min)

Goal: get a local backup of text and images before anyone cancels Squarespace.

Run on your own machine (not in chat), with permission:

```sh
mkdir -p backup
wget \
  --mirror --page-requisites --adjust-extension --convert-links \
  --span-hosts --no-parent \
  --domains emilypotts.ca,images.squarespace-cdn.com \
  -P backup \
  https://emilypotts.ca/
```

Notes:
- This helps you grab images and copy, but do not assume the mirrored HTML is clean or legally reusable.
- Manually save key images Emily owns (portrait shots, custom graphics) into an `assets/` folder.

### 3) Choose the build style (5 min decision)

Option A: Plain HTML + CSS (fastest, least magic)
- Best if you want tight control and zero Jekyll weirdness.
- Works perfectly on GitHub Pages.

Option B: Jekyll (still simple, nicer for repeated header/footer + blog)
- GitHub Pages supports Jekyll natively.
- Makes "Resources" posts easier if she will add more.

Recommendation: If finishing the core rebuild in a morning, pick Option A unless Emily will actively blog.

### 4) Build the repo skeleton (20-30 min)

Goal: working site structure + routing that matches the current URLs.

Suggested structure (plain HTML version):

```
/
  index.html
  about/index.html
  services-and-fees/index.html
  therapy/index.html
  faqs/index.html
  resources/index.html
  resources/
    Blog Post Title One-y2epy-y63ns/index.html
    exploring-solutions-for-climate-anxiety/index.html
  contact/index.html
  privacy-page/index.html
  assets/
    css/styles.css
    img/...
```

Yes, that weird "Blog Post Title One-y2epy-y63ns" folder name with spaces is awkward, but it matches the live URL (`%20` in the URL = spaces in the folder name).

### 5) Recreate global components (30-45 min)

Goal: every page shares the same top + bottom.

Header/nav links:
- About -> `/about/`
- Services & Fees -> `/services-and-fees/`
- Resources -> `/resources/`
- FAQs -> `/faqs/`
- Contact -> `/contact/`
- Newsletter -> Substack (external)
- Book Now -> JaneApp (external)

Footer:
- Crisis line copy (BC Crisis Centre number appears across pages)
- Land acknowledgement text (appears in footer)
- Privacy Policy link -> `/privacy-page/`

### 6) Port page content (60-90 min)

Order:
1. Home
2. About
3. Services & Fees
4. Contact
5. FAQs
6. Resources index + 2 posts
7. Privacy

As you paste in content, make sure:
- Headings match (H1/H2) so SEO does not tank.
- Buttons keep the same destinations (JaneApp, Substack, YouTube).

### 7) Replace Squarespace-only functionality (30-45 min)

Contact form: GitHub Pages cannot process forms.

Pick one:
- Formspree (simple, free tier): static HTML form posts to Formspree, emails Emily
- Google Form embed (free, less polished)
- `mailto:` link (lowest friction, but worse UX, and can leak emails to scrapers)

Important: the current site has a privacy policy and references a `privacy@emilypotts.ca` address. If you change form vendors, update the policy to reflect new data processing.

### 8) Match styling (45-90 min)

Goal: close-enough visual match without copying Squarespace template code.

In a browser:
- Extract font families, font sizes, colors, max width, spacing, button styles
- Screenshot each major section on desktop + mobile

Then implement in CSS:
- CSS variables: `--bg`, `--text`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--max-width`, etc.
- A simple responsive grid for:
  - hero section
  - 2-column image/text blocks
  - the 3-tile services block
  - Mobile nav: either a simple stacked menu or minimal JS to toggle

Known typography + palette (from live CSS):
- Heading/body: "Sorts Mill Goudy" (Google Fonts)
- Buttons: "Halyard Display" (Adobe Fonts; use free fallback if no kit)
- Palette (HSL -> hex): accent #9b9eb4, white #f0efee, black #3f413c, lightAccent #1b1c54, darkAccent #747367

Free font alternatives for "Halyard Display" (buttons):
- Source Sans 3 (recommended)
- Work Sans
- Libre Franklin

### 9) Deploy preview on GitHub Pages (15-20 min)

Goal: a shareable link for Emily to review before DNS changes.
- Create repo (either `emilypotts` or `emilypotts.ca`)
- Settings -> Pages -> deploy from main branch /root
- Verify:
  - all internal links work
  - resources post with weird slug works
  - images load
  - contact form submits to your chosen provider

### 10) Domain cutover checklist (after preview approval)

Goal: avoid downtime + avoid breaking email.
- Add a CNAME file with `emilypotts.ca`
- In DNS:
  - Point apex A records to GitHub Pages IPs
  - Point www CNAME to `yourusername.github.io`
  - Do not touch MX records if she uses domain email
- After HTTPS is issued, confirm both www and apex redirect properly

## Gaps / blind spots to handle up front

Places migrations get burned:
1. "Free" is not fully free:
  - Domain renewal still costs money
  - Forms may become paid if volume grows
  - Analytics or privacy-compliant tooling may cost
2. Editing workflow:
  - If Emily is not technical, pushing updates via Git is friction.
  - Consider adding a lightweight CMS later (e.g., Decap CMS on GitHub), or keep a "request changes" process.
3. Legal/compliance:
  - Therapy sites + contact forms + privacy policies matter.
  - Keep the "not a crisis service" text prominent on Contact.
  - Ensure the privacy policy remains accessible and accurate after changing vendors.
4. Design ownership:
  - The footer credit suggests a designer/agency contributed.
  - Rebuild the look with your own code rather than copying Squarespace template assets.
