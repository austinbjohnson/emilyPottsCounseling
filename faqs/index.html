          <details>
            <summary>Who do you work with?</summary>
            <p>I work with adult individuals of all genders and intersections, as well as with relationships, friends, and family members. I&rsquo;m not currently taking on adolescents or teens.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you accept benefits?</summary>
            <p>Yes! Most insurance plans cover the care of a Registered Clinical Counselor in BC. However, you would need to explore this with your insurance plan as all plans have slight differences. The payment for the session will be billed directly to you after the session, and then, depending on your plan, you can file for coverage with the receipt provided.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you offer a sliding scale?</summary>
            <p>Yes! I acknowledge that therapy can be a difficult resource for many of us, therefore, I do offer a few sliding scale spots for those who are unable to pay for the full rate. These spots are limited and will be prioritized to individuals who are BIPOC and 2SLGBTQAI+ as well as folks who are experiencing financial hardship that limits them from accessing mental health services. Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this more.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What is your cancellation policy?</summary>
            <p>I ask that you provide at least 48 hours&rsquo; notice for cancellations. No-shows and appointments that are cancelled in less than 48 hours will be billed for the cost of the session.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What can I expect in our first session?</summary>
            <p>Our first session is a chance for us to get to know each other. I&rsquo;ll invite you to share a little about what&rsquo;s bringing you to therapy, and we&rsquo;ll explore what you&rsquo;re hoping for from our work together. There&rsquo;s no pressure to tell your whole story at once &mdash; we&rsquo;ll move at a pace that feels right for you.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I know if therapy with you is the right fit?</summary>
            <p>Finding the right therapist is so important. I offer a free 15-minute consultation so we can meet, hear a little about what you&rsquo;re looking for, and get a feel for whether working together feels like a good fit.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What&rsquo;s the difference between a 50, 75, and 100-minute session?</summary>
            <p>A 50-minute session offers space for steady, focused work. Longer sessions (75 or 100 minutes) can be helpful if you&rsquo;re navigating complex experiences, relationship dynamics, or want more time to settle into deeper emotional work. We can decide together what feels most supportive for you.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you offer Walk &amp; Talk sessions year-round?</summary>
            <p>Weather permitting, yes! Walk &amp; Talk sessions are available year-round. If the weather doesn&rsquo;t allow for an outdoor session, we&rsquo;ll either meet virtually or in-person indoors &mdash; whichever feels most comfortable for you.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>I&rsquo;m experiencing a lot of worry about the future of the planet. Is that something you can support?</summary>
            <p>Yes. Feelings like climate grief, eco-anxiety, or a deep sense of loss about the natural world are real, valid emotional experiences. You might feel sadness, fear, guilt, anger, or even numbness.</p>
            <p>In our work together, we can make space for those emotions without rushing to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; them &mdash; exploring how you carry them, and how you might stay connected to your own care and resilience.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use insurance or funding to cover therapy?</summary>
            <p>I am a registered clinical counsellor (RCC), which means many extended health plans will reimburse therapy fees. I&rsquo;m also registered with ICBC and CVAP for clients who have experienced a car accident or are survivors of violence or crime. I&rsquo;m happy to walk you through what options might be available to you.</p>
