          <h1>Let&rsquo;s meet as you are, how you are.</h1>
          <p>Taking the first step can feel like the hardest part. You&rsquo;re not alone, and you&rsquo;re in the right place.</p>
          <p>I&rsquo;m a registered clinical counsellor based in Vancouver, BC. I work with individuals and couples through a relational, trauma-informed lens, and also offer workshops, speaking, and writing rooted in climate-informed, feminist care.</p>

          <div class="eyebrow">Hi, I&rsquo;m Emily (she/her). I&rsquo;m so glad you are here.</div>
          <p>I believe healing happens when someone walks alongside you&mdash;not ahead, not behind, but beside you.</p>
          <p>Before becoming a therapist, I spent years guiding groups through the outdoors&mdash;helping people find their footing in unfamiliar places, building trust, and creating spaces where growth could unfold. Those experiences shaped how I work today: relational, grounded, and attuned to the ways we move through the world, both inside and out.</p>
          <p>In our sessions, humour and pain often dance together. One moment we might laugh, and the next we might explore something deeper. I create a space where all parts of you are welcome: the witty and the wounded, the confident and the confused.</p>

        <p class="lede">If you&rsquo;re looking for support or collaboration, you&rsquo;re in the right place. My work is rooted in feminist, climate-informed, and relational care.</p>

            <summary>Therapy</summary>
            <p>I provide a confidential, supportive space for individuals and couples to explore their thoughts, feelings, and patterns.</p>
            <p>Rooted in feminist and systems-based approaches, our work is collaborative&mdash;guided by your experiences, your insight, and your goals for healing.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Speaking</summary>
            <p>I offer speaking engagements and workshops at the intersection of climate change, mental health, and our connection to the natural world.</p>
            <p>My talks weave together psychoeducation, reflective practices, and open dialogue to leave people feeling empowered, hopeful, and more grounded in their purpose.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Workshops</summary>
            <p>I lead nature-based workshops that support therapists in reconnecting with themselves and their work.</p>
            <p>These gatherings focus on burnout recovery, community care, and reflection&mdash;held gently in outdoor settings.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">How I work with you</h2>
          <p>What matters most isn&rsquo;t the method&mdash;it&rsquo;s that you feel seen, safe, and free to be yourself here.</p>
          <p>I draw from a range of trauma-informed, relational approaches&mdash;including nature-based therapy, narrative work, and feminist theory.</p>
          <p>These frameworks support a therapy experience that&rsquo;s collaborative and deeply human. But more than anything, our work is shaped by you and your lived experience.</p>
