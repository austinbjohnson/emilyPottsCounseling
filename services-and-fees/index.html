        <h1>Therapy Services &amp; Fees</h1>
        <p>Therapy is a space where you don&rsquo;t have to have it all figured out.</p>
        <p>My practice offers individual and couples therapy, grounded in relational and feminist care. Below, you&rsquo;ll find more details on what to expect, how sessions are structured, and available rates.</p>
        <p>You don&rsquo;t need a diagnosis or a tidy story to begin. Just the sense that something inside you wants tending.</p>

        <p>Many extended health plans cover sessions with a registered clinical counsellor (RCC). I&rsquo;m also registered with ICBC and CVAP, which provide funding support for clients recovering from car accidents or impacted by violence or crime.</p>

        <p>Remember, these categories are just a starting place. Therapy with me is shaped by your lived experience, not a checklist. We can explore together whether this work feels right for you.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Commonly asked questions</h2>
        <div class="details-list">
          <details>
            <summary>What can I expect in our first session?</summary>
            <p>Our first session is a chance for us to get to know each other. I&rsquo;ll invite you to share a little about what&rsquo;s bringing you to therapy, and we&rsquo;ll explore what you&rsquo;re hoping for from our work together. There&rsquo;s no pressure to tell your whole story at once &mdash; we&rsquo;ll move at a pace that feels right for you.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I know if therapy with you is the right fit?</summary>
            <p>Finding the right therapist is so important. I offer a free 15-minute consultation so we can meet, hear a little about what you&rsquo;re looking for, and get a feel for whether working together feels like a good fit.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What&rsquo;s the difference between a 50 and 75-minute session?</summary>
            <p>A 50-minute session offers space for steady, focused work. Longer sessions can be helpful if you&rsquo;re navigating complex experiences, relationship dynamics, or want more time to settle into deeper emotional work. We can decide together what feels most supportive for you.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you offer Walk &amp; Talk sessions year-round?</summary>
            <p>Weather permitting, yes! Walk &amp; Talk sessions are available year-round. If for some reason the weather doesn&rsquo;t feel safe to be outside, we&rsquo;ll either meet virtually or in-person indoors &mdash; whichever feels most comfortable for you.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>I&rsquo;m experiencing a lot of worry about the future of the planet. Is that something you can support?</summary>
            <p>Yes. Feelings like climate grief, eco-anxiety, or a deep sense of loss about the natural world are real, valid emotional experiences. You might feel sadness, fear, guilt, anger, or even numbness.</p>
            <p>As a climate-aware counsellor, my hope is to guide our work to make space for those emotions without rushing to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; them &mdash; exploring how you carry them, and how you might stay connected to your own care and resilience.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use insurance or funding to cover therapy?</summary>
            <p>I am a registered clinical counsellor (RCC), which means many extended health plans will reimburse therapy fees. I&rsquo;m also registered with ICBC and CVAP for clients who have experienced a car accident or are survivors of violence or crime. I&rsquo;m happy to walk you through what options might be available to you.</p>
